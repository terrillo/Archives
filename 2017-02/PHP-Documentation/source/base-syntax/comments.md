# PHP Comments

A comment in PHP code is a line that is not read/executed as part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code. PHP supports 'C', 'C++' and Unix shell-style (Perl style) comments.

The purpose of comments:
- Let others understand what you are doing
- Remind yourself of what you did 
- Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code

### PHP Comments Example

```php
<?php
    echo 'Hello World'; // This is a one-line comment

    /* This is a multi line comment
       yet another line of comment */

    echo 'Hello World'; # This is a one-line comment
?>
```

**With HTML comments**

```php

<!-- <?php echo 'Hello World' ?> -->

```
