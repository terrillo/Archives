# PHP Tags

## PHP Base Syntax

When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are ```<?php and ?>``` which tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them.


### Basic PHP Tags Example

```php
<?php echo "Hello world"; ?>
```

### PHP.ini (short_open_tag)

PHP also allows for the short open tag to be used ```<?``` (Only available if enabled using the short_open_tag option in ```php.ini```)

```
short_open_tag=On
```
